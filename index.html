                            <p>Hi! I'm Susanna! I'm currently a senior at Drexel taking a small break from classes to figure out the next steps in my life! This coding opportunity honestly came out of nowhere. It was totally unexpected that I'd be able to enroll in a program so close by! I'm so thankful that I have this opportunity to learn and I want to make sure that I make the most out of it! It's been great learning so many new and challenging things so far. I have always been interested in web designing through small things like designing my own blog page through wix's platform. I hope that I'll be able to develop and design better websites past the options that I can get on wix or other blogging platforms with the things I'll get to learn through this program! I also hope to meet and get to know many of the other classmates and expand my networking circle as well.</p>
                            <p>Some other random things about me include that I am the oldest of two brothers in my family. I am Korean-American, born in Flushing, New York. I have lived in many different places including 4 different states and South Korea. Music has always been a part of my life including singing and playing piano/guitar. I'm a devoted Christian and highly involved with my church community on campus. I can be quite shy when meeting new people in a new environment but once I'm comfortable, you'll find that I'm an easy person to talk to! Other interests of mine include photography and "vlogging". I say "vlogging" because it's nothing professional or official, just whenever I get to travel somewhere and I remember to record stuff!</p>
